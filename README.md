# ChatBot
ChatBot i made, as part of the recruitment process for the IBM CIC

General info:
I have not made my own API for this task. The reason for this being that, i tried making an API on AWS, but i ended up spending too much time figuring out how to do it.

I understand the basic principles of making an API, since i have made one with Express before.

I tried making an Express API for this project as well, but couldnt get it to work in time. I will include the "app.js" in the project as well, just so you can see what i was working on.

Instead of getting data from an API, i get the data from the Database class, which is not optimal, but similar to the way i was gonna use the API.

I have still used two different external API's to show that i have the ability to work with an API.

Reasoning for technology:
The main reasoning for using Visual Studio and C#, is because this is where i am most comfortable, and have the most experience.
C# is really good at making quick applications.

I used "Newtonsoft" Package, to help serialize JSON.
